# Nexus Studio (AutoGen Studio + TensorRT-LLM)

### Dependencies
- Set up TensorRT-LLM OpenAI project(https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-as-openai-windows) in another location, launch at port:8081
- Most of front-end is built and included with the repo
- Python deps need to be installed

The env variables are setup at autogenstudio/env.py. The API keys are NOT required to run the application, but may be required for certain API-related skills

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If any Skills script throw a dependency error, other requirements such as requirements_a2f.txt.

### Running the Application

Once installed, run the web UI by entering the following in your terminal:

```bash
autogenstudio ui --port 8088
```

This will start the application on the specified port. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/` to begin using AutoGen Studio.
AutoGen Studio also takes a `--host <host>` argument to specify the host address. By default, it is set to `localhost`. You can also use the `--appdir <appdir>` argument to specify the directory where the app files (e.g., database and generated user files) are stored. By default, it is set to the directory where autogen pip package is installed.

Now that you have AutoGen Studio installed and running, you are ready to explore its capabilities, including defining and modifying agent workflows, interacting with agents and sessions, and expanding agent skills.

## Capabilities

AutoGen Studio proposes some high-level concepts.

**Agent Workflow**: An agent workflow is a specification of a set of agents that can work together to accomplish a task. The simplest version of this is a setup with two agents – a user proxy agent (that represents a user i.e. it compiles code and prints result) and an assistant that can address task requests (e.g., generating plans, writing code, evaluating responses, proposing error recovery steps, etc.). A more complex flow could be a group chat where even more agents work towards a solution.

**Session**: A session refers to a period of continuous interaction or engagement with an agent workflow, typically characterized by a sequence of activities or operations aimed at achieving specific objectives. It includes the agent workflow configuration, the interactions between the user and the agents. A session can be “published” to a “gallery”.

**Skills**: Skills are functions (e.g., Python functions) that describe how to solve a task. In general, a good skill has a descriptive name (e.g. `generate_images`), extensive docstrings and good defaults (e.g., writing out files to disk for persistence and reuse). You can add new skills AutoGen Studio app via the provided UI. At inference time, these skills are made available to the assistant agent as they address your tasks.

AutoGen Studio comes with 3 example skills: `fetch_profile`, `find_papers`, `generate_images`. The default skills, agents and workflows are based on the [dbdefaults.json](autogentstudio/utils/dbdefaults.json) file which is used to initialize the database.

## Example Usage

Consider the following query.

```
Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price YTD. Save the result to a file named nvda_tesla.png
```

The agent workflow responds by _writing and executing code_ to create a python program to generate the chart with the stock prices.

> Note than there could be multiple turns between the `AssistantAgent` and the `UserProxyAgent` to produce and execute the code in order to complete the task.

> Note: You can also view the debug console that generates useful information to see how the agents are interacting in the background.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I specify the directory where files(e.g. database) are stored?**

A: You can specify the directory where files are stored by setting the `--appdir` argument when running the application. For example, `autogenstudio ui --appdir /path/to/folder`. This will store the database and other files in the specified directory e.g. `/path/to/folder/database.sqlite`.

**Q: Where can I adjust the default skills, agent and workflow configurations?**
A: You can modify agent configurations directly from the UI or by editing the [dbdefaults.json](autogenstudio/utils/dbdefaults.json) file which is used to initialize the database.

**Q: If I want to reset the entire conversation with an agent, how do I go about it?**
A: To reset your conversation history, you can delete the `database.sqlite` file in the `--appdir` directory. This will reset the entire conversation history. To delete user files, you can delete the `files` directory in the `--appdir` directory.

**Q: Is it possible to view the output and messages generated by the agents during interactions?**
A: Yes, you can view the generated messages in the debug console of the web UI, providing insights into the agent interactions. Alternatively, you can inspect the `database.sqlite` file for a comprehensive record of messages.

**Q: Can I use other models with AutoGen Studio?**
Yes. AutoGen standardizes on the openai model api format, and you can use any api server that offers an openai compliant endpoint. In the AutoGen Studio UI, each agent has an `llm_config` field where you can input your model endpoint details including `model`, `api key`, `base url`, `model type` and `api version`. For Azure OpenAI models, you can find these details in the Azure portal. Note that for Azure OpenAI, the `model name` is the deployment id or engine, and the `model type` is "azure".
For other OSS models, we recommend using a server such as vllm to instantiate an openai compliant endpoint.

**Q: The server starts but I can't access the UI**
A: If you are running the server on a remote machine (or a local machine that fails to resolve localhost correstly), you may need to specify the host address. By default, the host address is set to `localhost`. You can specify the host address using the `--host <host>` argument. For example, to start the server on port 8081 and local address such that it is accessible from other machines on the network, you can run the following command:

```bash
autogenstudio ui --port 8081 --host 0.0.0.0
```
